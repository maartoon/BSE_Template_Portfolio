# Martin's Smart Mirror
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone was finishing the final touches for the features I had implemented and to attach the monitor to the two-sided mirror. After writing the code for all the features I wanted, I started using flexbox, a CSS Flexible Box Layout tool to help me design the layout of the smart mirror. I also downloaded some free fonts on the internet and customized my display that way. After I finished with all of that, I hot glued the monitor to the back of the mirror. Since it's a two-sided mirror, I will be ableto see all the information on the monitor as long as there's enough light.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was completing the code for the date, time, and weather for my smart mirror display. First, I installed the Smart Mirror repository from GitHub so I could write my code from scratch using said repository. Then, I started coding the date and time for my smart mirror. Although I wasn't used to coding in Javascript, I looked at a pre-made clock class for reference and completed it successfully. Then, I moved onto the weather display feature which forced me to work with APIs for the first time. It was a challenge at first, trying to figure how to pull data from an API. But, after watching a few tutorials and seeking help from my instructor, I was able to complete it successfully as well. Lastly, I started the code for my Calendar but didn't finish yet. It is very similar to the code for the Weather class, so I will be able to finish easily. Below is some pictures and videos of my milestone:

This is the code that updates the time every second, which displays like this:

This is my code that gets the weather data from the API and returns it onto the smart mirror. Here is how it looks currently:

Lastly, here is my code that loops through the most recent 5 items on my To-Do List and prints it onto the smart mirror:

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary software on my computer. First, I followed a guide to set up a Raspberry Pi on the internet and plugged everything into the right place. In order to set up the Raspberry Pi, I had to plug the Micro SD card into my computer and use the Raspberry Pi Imager software and write everything necessary into the SD card. Following this step, I could then plug the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and continue with the set up through the monitor that's connected to the Raspberry Pi. I had to install the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) on both my computer and the Raspberry Pi then download a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) software in order to set up my Raspberry Pi with the Smart Mirror software.

# Initial Design
Below is my inital design and drawing of the Smart Mirror. Although I'm not sure if I can implement all of these features within the three week period at BlueStamp Engineering, I will be sure to build on my progress and improve my mirror in the future.
